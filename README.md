## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Traditional cybersecurity education is **boring, static, and ineffective**. Students read theory, take quizzes, and forget everything the next week. There's no immersion, no real practice, no personalization.

**Code Obsidian flips this entirely.** We built a platform where learning cybersecurity feels like playing a high-stakes game — guided by a personal AI mentor that knows exactly where you are, what you need, and where you should go next.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🐉 Gamified Authentication
The moment a user lands on the app, they know this is different. A **live 3D dragon** (built with Three.js & React Three Fiber) tracks the user's cursor in real-time on the login screen — setting the tone: this is not your average learning platform.

### 🧠 AI Skill Path Prediction
Powered by the **Groq API**, the platform analyzes a user's current competencies across Python, Network Security, Web Exploitation, and more — then **predicts their optimal learning path**. Not just where you are, but where you *should* go next.

### 🔬 Cyber Lab — Learn by Doing
The heart of the platform. Four fully interactive modules:
- **AI Attack Simulator** — Input attack vectors, watch step-by-step simulations powered by AI
- **Vulnerability Visualizer** — Graphical tool showing where security weaknesses exist in real architectures
- **Payload Playground** — Safe sandbox for experimenting with SQL injection, XSS, and more with AI-assisted suggestions
- **CTF Challenges** — Capture-the-flag exercises with real success states, visual rewards, and proof of completion

### 🤖 Zara — Your AI Mentor
Not a generic chatbot. **Zara** knows what screen you're on, what skill node you're studying, and what your recent progress is. She gives contextual hints without handing you the answer — like a real mentor.

### 💻 Professional Code Editor
Powered by **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code), with syntax highlighting, embedded directly in the browser. Code runs live via the **Judge0 API** in a secure sandbox — real execution, real results.

### 🎓 Adaptive Learning Modes
- **Strict Mode** — No hand-holding, maximum challenge
- **Guided Mode** — Step-by-step hints and structured flow
- **Review Mode** — Reinforces weak areas intelligently

### 📊 Skill Graph & Progress Tracking
A living visual web showing skill competencies and connections — not a static progress bar, but a **dynamic knowledge map** that evolves with the learner.
